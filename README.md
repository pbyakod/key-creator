## Key Creator

### Short Description
This project develops a webpage designed to generate random passwords, so you dont have to yourself! The password generator creats a string of characters based on various specifications that the user inputs themself, making it unique to every individual. A significant reason for developing this program is because I've never been good at creating unique passwords that are easy to remember before. By using this password generator, I can generate a never-before-seen code which can be easy to remember, sice I inputted my required specifications for the password beforehand.
